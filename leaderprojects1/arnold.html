        <p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor, <br> businessman, filmmaker, former politician, and former professional bodybuilder known <br> for his roles in high-profile action movies. He served as the 38th governor of California <br> from 2003 to 2011 and was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and 2007.[5][6]</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time,[7][8] and has written many books and articles about it.[9] The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.[10] He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977). After retiring from bodybuilding, he gained <br> worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982),[11] a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984.[12] After playing the title character in the <br> science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and three other sequels. His other successful action films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True <br> Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Jingle All the Way (1996).[13] He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.[14] <br>

            As a registered Republican, Schwarzenegger chaired the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during most of the George H. W. Bush administration. On October <br> 7, 2003, he was elected Governor of California in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn <br> in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was reelected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term.[15] In 2011 he reached his term limit as governor and <br> returned to acting.Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career,[16] and "the Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, <br> a niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.[17]

        <p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947,[18] the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife Aurelia (née Jadrny; 1922–1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and after the Anschluss in 1938 joined the Nazi Party and in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, Gustav served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the title of Hauptfeldwebel.[19][20] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[21] and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served "in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role."[19] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected.[22]</p>

        <p>Gustav married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared."[23] He grew up in a Catholic family.[24] Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[25] His favoritism was "strong and blatant", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[26] Schwarzenegger says that his earliest childhood memory is of climbing into his parents' bed during a bad thunder-and-lightning storm and cuddling between his mother and father.[27] He has said, however, that his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems".[24] He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.[28]</p>

                <h2>Bodybuilding career</h2>
            </main>
        </header>
        <p>Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[10] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

            For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[51] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[51] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[51]
            
            One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[18] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[18][33] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 – NABBA [England], 1 – IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.
            
            Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.[52]</p>

        </header>
        <p>During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963[53] and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.[4]

            In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.</p>
